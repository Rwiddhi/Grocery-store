# Grocery Store Website
A full-stack web application built for a grocery store, enabling users to register, log in, browse products, add items to their cart, and make purchases. The application features user authentication, product filtering, and a secure checkout process. The project uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the frontend, with Node.js and Express.js on the backend, and stores data using MongoDB. Additionally, the application is fully responsive, integrates with JWT for authentication.

This project demonstrates the integration of modern web development technologies, ensuring security (via bcrypt password hashing), efficiency (through asynchronous requests using AJAX), and scalability.
